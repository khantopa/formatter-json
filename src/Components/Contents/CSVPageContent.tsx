        readable and can be opened with various applications such as
        spreadsheets and databases. By converting your JSON data to CSV, you can
        perform complex data operations, apply filters, and conduct advanced
        calculations with ease.

        3. Reduced File Size and Efficient Data Transfer
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        JSON files can be larger in size compared to their CSV counterparts due
        to their structure and additional formatting elements. Converting JSON
        to CSV results in reduced file sizes, which leads to faster data
        transfer and improved website performance. Search engines like Google
        take loading speed into consideration when ranking websites, making CSV
        files a favorable choice for better SEO.
